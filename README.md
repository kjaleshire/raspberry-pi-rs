##### A collection of Raspberry pi 2 bare metal programs. In Rust.

These examples are for Raspberry pi 2 (I don't have a pi or pi zero). It would be trivial to recompile these examples for pi, just change the GPIO base address from 0x3F00_0000 to 0x2000_0000 and the target architecture to armv6.

Major credit to David Welch <dwelch@dwelch.com> for providing bare-metal examples in C at [http://github.com/dwelch67/raspberry-pi](http://github.com/dwelch67/raspberry-pi)
